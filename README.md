# mywsbcss

A refactor of legacy WORDsearch CSS for myWSB EPUBs, mywsb.css is (mostly) written to this standard: http://cssguidelin.es/ but with EPUB-specific uses cases in mind.

mywsb.css acts as the default stylesheet for all EPUBs developed by the B&H Direct eBook Development team and can be tweaked or extended with a separate stylesheet.

* Use the minified mywsb.css in the main folder in all projects for production environments.
* Refer to `src/mywsb.scss` for a human-readable development resource.
